# Recommender-for-books

I have created this model for the recommendations of books to a user. This recommendation system is context-based (on the reviews of the books read by the user). The input to this model is book_id of the read book and the model recommends three books to the user. For textual analysis, I have used a TF-IDF vectorizer. I have added the Jupyter notebook file for the code.
